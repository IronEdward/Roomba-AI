Difficulties:
1. We have the coordinates of the center of the circles which the robot has passed through. How do we get the total area of the path the robot has gone through, because the areas overlap
2. Too much computing power required...?
-------------------------------------
Solution:
Just calculate the square area of the most separated 4 points. 
(If that makes sense...)

That doesn't seem right...

Well, it's a stupid approximation. Probably works unless the values are really similar, which is most likely the case in the beginning...
